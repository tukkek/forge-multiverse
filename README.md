# Multiverse world for Forge

This is a custom quest-mode world for Forge https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge

It merges all of the built-in block-worlds pre-2000s into a single "Multiverse". Namely:

- Rabiah (`1993-12 Arabian Nights/`)
- Terisiare (`1994-03 Antiquities/`)
- Dominaria: Legends (`1994-06 Legends/`)
- Terisiare: The Dark (`1994-08 The Dark/`)
- Sarpadia (`1994-11 Fallen Empires/`)
- Homelands (`1995-10 Homelands/`)
- Terisiare: Ice Age (`1996-05 Ice Age/`)
- Jamuraa: The Mirage Wars (`1997-01 Mirage/`)
- Jamuraa (`jamuraa/`)
- Shandalar (`shandalar/`)
- Tempest (`Tempest/`)
- Urza's Block (`Urza/`)

This allows players to enjoy a full-fledged world with more variety, including 500 duel opponents and 100 challenges - without arbitrarily traveling between worlds. 

Quest-mode draft tournaments will also enjoy a pool of 20 sets to draw from at once rather than as little as a single set for some of the built-in game worlds.

The Multiverse world has been playtested with a custom format, including the Classic Sixth Edition core set and all the 17 expansions from Arabian Nights to Urza's block.

## Installation

1. Download the Multiverse world https://github.com/tukkek/forge-multiverse/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. Extract it on the `res/quest/world/` sub-folder of your Forge Installation.
3. Copy-paste the line from `add to worlds.txt` to `worlds.txt` in the same folder.

Step 3 is necessary so Multiverse can work with any future version of Forge while retaining the built-in worlds (some of which are necessary for Forge to function).

## Rationale

These sets are just my favorite era for the game, only partly based on nostalgia as I only played a couple of these expansions contemporarily (around Ice Age).

Sixth-edition is the officialy-named "Classic" edition and provided a major rule-set re-design and it makes sense to use it to cap off all the earlier expansions. This offers plenty of variety with a revised rule-set and a well-defined classic feel.

My arbitrary cut-off point are Invasion's split cards, where I feel the game lost much of its simplicity and power-creep started sky-rocketing. As such, Sixth-edition's launch and the closing of the Urza block in 1999 are a good milestone.

This happens to also be exactly the landmark when Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast and the Masques block started in September 1999.

Awkward cards (especially earlier on) and keyword-bloat already existed prior but this time-frame provides a good blend of variety, balance, feel and simplicity.
